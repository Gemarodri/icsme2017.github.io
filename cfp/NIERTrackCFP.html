          <h2>NIER (New Ideas and Emerging Results) Track â€“ Call for Papers</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp ERA becomes NIER! The goal of the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track is to provide researchers and practitioners with a forum for presenting great, promising ideas in early stages of research. These ideas do not require a strong empirical evaluation! To underpin this point, we renamed this track, from ERA to NIER. The 2017 NIER track aims to provide constructive feedback to guide you from your initial idea and limited evaluation towards a solid ICSME 2018 paper with strong empirical underpinnings. The topics of interest for this track are the same as for the main research track, that is, all the topics in the research and practice of software maintenance and evolution. Papers submitted to ICSME NIER 2017 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME NIER 2017.</p>
          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their originality, importance of contribution, soundness, quality and consistency of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work. Special emphasis will be put on the originality and timeliness of the proposed contribution, that is, a full evaluation of the proposed ideas is not required. Submissions will be reviewed by members of the ICSME NIER 2017 Program Committee.</p>
          <h3>Publication and Presentation</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp Upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will be asked to complete an IEEE Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera ready versions. Accepted papers will be published in the conference electronic proceedings, which will also be available in the IEEE Digital Library. Accepted papers will be presented in a formal setting and as a poster. At least one author of the paper must register and present the paper at the conference for the paper to be published in the proceedings. More details on the presentations will follow the notifications.</p>
          <h3>How to Submit</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp We are introducing a double-blind reviewing process for the ICSME 2017 NIER Track. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules:</p>

            <li> References to authors' own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not "We build on our previous work..." but rather "We build on the work of...")</li>
          </ul>
