          <h2>Tool Demo Track - Call for Papers </h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Goal and Scope</h3>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp The ICSME 2017 tool demonstration track is the ideal venue for practitioners and researchers to discuss the cutting edge of software maintenance and evolution tool support. Tools can range from mature prototypes to fully developed products that are being prepared for commercialization (but are not yet commercialized). Any of the conference topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations.</p>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp We especially encourage the submission of tool demonstrations that complement research papers. In this case, the tool demonstration represents a good opportunity to show how a proposed technique/approach has been implemented in a working tool prototype. </p>

          <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp Submissions of proposals for tool demonstrations must:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Fall under the topics mentioned for the ICSME 2017 research track;</li>
            <li>Adhere to the conference proceedings style;</li>
            <li>Have a maximum of 4 pages + 1 page for references only;</li>
            <li>Be uploaded electronically in PDF format via the ICSME 2017 Easychair submission site.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp All submissions to the tool demo track must provide in the abstract a link to a 3-to-5 minute screencast providing a concise version of the tool demo scenario. The video can be made available via YouTube (as a private video) or in the toolâ€™s website. </p>

          <h3>Evaluation</h3>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the tool demonstration program committee. The committee will review each submission on its merits, novelty, and quality.</p>

          <h3>Presentation</h3>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp Accepted tool demonstrations will be allocated 5 pages in the conference proceedings. Demonstrators will be invited to give a presentation that will be scheduled into the conference program.</p>

          <h3>Important Dates (Tentative)</h3>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp Abstracts: June 19, 2017</p>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp Papers: June 26, 2017</p>
