            <h4>Title: Ladies and Gentlemen, Start your Engine: Being Successful with your PhD Without Crashing at the First Corner</h4>
            <p><b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will provide you with my very personal hints on how to deal with the nightmares and challenges everybody encounters during a PhD, and right after. Look at your PhD as a racing championship: you can loose one or more races for various reasons that may not even depend on you. However, only the perseverance, the continuous development of innovative solution will let you win the championship, or will let you be hired by a top team for the next year. On the one side, the talk will give you some advices from a technical point of view, including balancing theoretical research with tool development, and allocating enough resources and time to evaluate your research from different perspectives. On the other side, the talk will deal with the PhD and post-doc management issues, including adapting your work habit to a specific context, choosing publication venues, relating with your advisor, colleagues, and other researchers. In the end, as it happens for racing, the key point is having fun. If you are having fun with your research, then you will be very successful with it.</p>
