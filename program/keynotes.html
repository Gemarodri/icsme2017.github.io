                        &nbsp &nbsp Margaret-Anne Storey is a Professor of Computer Science and the Director of the Software Engineering program at the University of Victoria. She holds a Canada Research Chair in Human and Social Aspects of Software Engineering and currently holds the Lise Meitner Guest Professorship at Lund University in Sweden.  Her main research goal is to understand how technology can help people explore, understand, and share complex information and knowledge. She evaluates and applies techniques from knowledge engineering, social software, and visual interface design to applications such as collaborative software development, program comprehension, biomedical ontology development, and learning in Web-based environments. Dr. Storey regularly collaborates with high tech companies to ensure real-world applicability to her solutions.
