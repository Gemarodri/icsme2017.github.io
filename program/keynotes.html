                      <h4>Topic: The Elusive Nature of Software Documentation and Why Understanding How Knowledge Flows Matters</h4>
                      <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        <b>Abstract: </b>Many developers consider writing documentation to be a painful and under-appreciated activity, yet the same developers often complain that a lack of documentation significantly hampers their work. Other developers argue that documentation is pass√© as developers more readily curate and exchange knowledge through networked platforms such as Slack, Twitter, and Stack Overflow. And while the savvy modern developer will know who to follow, who to ask, and where to look when they need software knowledge, finding the right knowledge at the right time remains a serious development bottleneck for many. Recognizing that these platforms contain golden nuggets of useful information, we see tremendous effort being directed at designing methods for capturing, mining, extracting, and distributing software knowledge, but will they succeed if we lack a good understanding of how knowledge flows in software development projects and communities? Through this talk, I will discuss the elusive nature of documentation and why I believe documentation will always be hard to define, capture, distribute, keep up to date, and to find, and I will argue that we should focus more on understanding, supporting, and amplifying knowledge flow in distributed software development.

                        <b>Bio: </b>Margaret-Anne Storey is a Professor of Computer Science and the Director of the Software Engineering program at the University of Victoria. She holds a Canada Research Chair in Human and Social Aspects of Software Engineering and currently holds the Lise Meitner Guest Professorship at Lund University in Sweden.  Her main research goal is to understand how technology can help people explore, understand, and share complex information and knowledge. She evaluates and applies techniques from knowledge engineering, social software, and visual interface design to applications such as collaborative software development, program comprehension, biomedical ontology development, and learning in Web-based environments. Dr. Storey regularly collaborates with high tech companies to ensure real-world applicability to her solutions.
