        <h3>Why Stay at a Conference Hotel?</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp You'll be in the center of conference activity, that's why! You'll be able to network easily with other conference attendees. You'll have a better conference experience overall. But there are other reasons that you need to consider before you look at a hotel outside the official ICSME 2017 room block.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp The conference staff have taken their role of finding a conference site very seriously. They have looked at a number of locations and evaluated the needs of attendees as well as the need for conference meeting space. Based on a guaranteed percentage of attendees staying in official conference hotels, the hotels provide discounted​ group​ rates from their normal charges.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp &nbsp If the conference does not meet the contracted sleeping room commitment, the hotel in some cases can charge the​ conference for the missing revenue. Unfilled rooms can cost the ​conference thousands of dollars which can apply pressure to increase the conference registration fees to offset these costs. So, please support the conference by staying at the official conference hotel​​. We think you will find the increased networking opportunities, quality hotelservices and amenities, and proximity to the conference activities to be worth it!</p>
